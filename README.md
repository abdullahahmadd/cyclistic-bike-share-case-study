## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes data from the **Cyclistic Divvy Q1 2020 bike-share dataset**, originally containing over **300,000 rows**.  
To ensure smooth performance across tools, the dataset was reduced to **8,036 rows** while preserving distribution and patterns.

The goal of the project is to understand **how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently**, and develop **data-driven marketing recommendations** to increase annual membership conversions.

The analysis follows the **Google Data Analytics process**:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

Work was performed in **Excel**, **MySQL**, and **RStudio (tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2)**.

## 🧵 Dataset Story

### **Original Attributes (Raw Dataset)**
- `ride_id`, `rideable_type`  
- `started_at`, `ended_at`  
- `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`  
- `end_station_name`, `end_station_id`  
- `start_lat`, `start_lng`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`  
- `member_casual`

### **New Attributes Created (Process Phase)**

**Excel:** `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, `start_hour`, `start_month`  
**SQL:** `started_at_dt`, `ended_at_dt`, `ride_length_secs`, `ride_length_mins`  
**R:** `weekday`, `started_hour_new`, `started_month_new`, `started_date`, `is_weekend`

These engineered features allowed deeper behavioral analysis.

- **Tourist → Monthly Upgrade Discount**

### 3. **Leverage digital media to convert casual riders**  
Highlight:  
- Cost savings  
- Convenience  
- Unlimited rides  
- Rewards/points  
- No per-ride charges  

These align well with casual rider behaviors.
